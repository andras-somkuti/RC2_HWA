R-Coding2 Homework Assignment

In this assignment I am creating a script to scrape Google News. Please note that this is strictly meant as a theoretical and proof of concept as Google robots.txt disallows scraping of the news search function.

Nevertheless to test the scraper functionality, the script was run to completion once and the output is saved in the repository. This required a vpn service, which element was not automated.
